# Soft-drink
I have created a website for a soft drink company using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These languages help me to write concise and efficient code.

# Features
The website is not responsive design so try to open in desktop.
The website has a navigation bar that allows the user to access different pages of the website.

# How to use
To view the website, you need a web browser that supports HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
To run the website locally, you need a web server that can serve static files.
To edit the website, you need a code editor that can edit HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
